This is RF24 edit for Ino Build Tool.


Ino

Ino is a command line toolkit for working with Arduino hardware

It allows you to:

Quickly create new projects
Build a firmware from multiple source files and libraries
Upload the firmware to a device
Perform serial communication with a device (aka serial monitor)
Ino may replace Arduino IDE UI if you prefer to work with command line and an editor of your choice or if you want to integrate Arduino build process to 3-rd party IDE.

Ino is based on make to perform builds. However Makefiles are generated automatically and you’ll never see them if you don’t want to.
